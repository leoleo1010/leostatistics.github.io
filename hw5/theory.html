        In probability, statistics and related fields, a Poisson point process is a type of random mathematical
        object that consists of points randomly located on a mathematical space with the essential feature that
        the points occur independently of one another. When the process is defined on the real line, it is often
        called simply the <b>Poisson process.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Its name derives from the fact that if a collection of random points in some space forms a Poisson process,
        then the number of points in a region of finite size is a random variable with a Poisson distribution. The
        process was discovered independently and repeatedly in several settings, including experiments on radioactive
        decay, telephone call arrivals and insurance mathematics.

        <b>Here are some important properties and characteristics of a Poisson point process:</b>
        <ul>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Randomness:</b> A Poisson point process is a random process, which means that the 
                location and number of points in a region are inherently unpredictable. However, it has a well-defined
                average density of points.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Stationarity:</b> A Poisson point process is often assumed to be stationary, meaning that
                the average point density is the same everywhere within the region of interest. In other words, the process
                does not exhibit any systematic spatial trends.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Independence:</b> The occurrence of points in different regions of space is typically
                assumed to be independent of each other. This means that the presence or absence of a point in one 
                region does not affect the presence or absence of points in other regions.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Homogeneity:</b> The point process is homogeneous in the sense that the average density
                of points is constant over the entire region of interest.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Poisson Distribution:</b> The number of points in a fixed region of interest
                (e.g., a square, circle, or any other shape) follows a Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution 
                is characterized by a single parameter, often denoted as 位 (lambda), which represents the average number 
                of points in that region.</li>
        </ul>
        The Poisson distribution is the probability distribution of a random variable called a Poisson random 
        variable such that the probability that N equals n is given by:
       <b>P(N = n) = (位^n * e^(-位)) / n!</b>
       <ul>
          <li class="list-item"><b>P(N = n):</b>is the probability of observing k points in the region.</li> 
          <li class="list-item"><b>位:</b>is the average number of points in the region.</li>  
          <li class="list-item"><b>e:</b> is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)</li>  
          <li class="list-item"><b>n!:</b>s the factorial of k.</li>  
       </ul>

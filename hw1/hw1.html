        <h3> - What is Statistics and its relationship with other disciplines. Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h3>
        <p> Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that involves the collection, description, analysis, and inference 
            of conclusions from quantitative data. The mathematical theories behind statistics rely heavily on differential and
            integral calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory.This science represent the better way to manipulate the data,
            including ways to gather, review, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.</p>
        <p> In practice, statistics is the idea that we can learn about the properties of large sets of objects or events
            (a population) by studying the characteristics of a smaller number of similar objects or events (a sample).
            Gathering comprehensive data about an entire population is too costly, difficult, or impossible in many 
            cases so statistics start with a sample that can be conveniently or affordably observed.</p>

        <p> Statistics is deeply correlated with a lot of disciplines, infact we can see that it involves a lot of mathematical concepts,
            including probability theory, calculus, and linear algebra. <b>Mathematical techniques</b> are used to derive statistical
            methods and models. <b>In the natural sciences,</b> statistics is crucial for experimental design, data analysis, and drawing 
            conclusions. It's used in fields like physics, chemistry, biology, and environmental science. <b>In the social sciences,</b>
            such as psychology, sociology, and economics, statistics helps researchers study human behavior, social trends, and 
            economic phenomena. Statistics is indispensable in <b>medical research and healthcare</b>. It's used for clinical trials, 
            epidemiological studies, and analyzing patient data to make informed decisions about treatments and healthcare policies.
            <b>In business,</b> statistics is used for market research, forecasting, quality control, and decision-making. Economics relies
            heavily on statistics to analyze economic data, measure economic growth, and develop economic models.<b>Data science and 
            machine learning</b> heavily depend on statistics. Algorithms for data analysis, pattern recognition, and machine learning
            are rooted in statistical principles.<b>Finance professionals</b> use statistics for risk assessment, portfolio management, 
            and stock market analysis. Financial models often rely on statistical techniques; but there aren't all the disciplines
            correlated with this subject, there are a lot of more, but all based on the study and manipulation of data</p>
        <h4> Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h4>
        <p> The two major areas of statistics are known as <b>descriptive statistics</b>, which describes the properties of sample and 
            population data, and <b>inferential statistics</b>, which uses those properties to test hypotheses and draw conclusions. 
            Descriptive statistics include mean (average), variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Inferential statistics include linear 
            regression analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), logit/Probit models, and null hypothesis testing.
            <p>The key difference between descriptive and inferential statistics is descriptive statistics arenâ€™t used to make an 
                inference about a broader population, whereas inferential statistics are used for this purpose. Rather than being 
                used to report on the data set itself, inferential statistics are used to generate insights across vast data sets 
                that would be difficult or impossible to analyze.</p>

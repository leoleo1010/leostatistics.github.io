        <h3> - What is Statistics and its relationship with other disciplines. Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h3>
        <p>Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that involves the collection, description, analysis, and inference 
            of conclusions from quantitative data. The mathematical theories behind statistics rely heavily on differential and
            integral calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory.This science represent the better way to manipulate the data,
            including ways to gather, review, analyze, and draw conclusions from data</p>
            
        <p>In practice, statistics is the idea that we can learn about the properties of large sets of objects or events
            (a population) by studying the characteristics of a smaller number of similar objects or events (a sample).
            Gathering comprehensive data about an entire population is too costly, difficult, or impossible in many 
            cases so statistics start with a sample that can be conveniently or affordably observed.</p>

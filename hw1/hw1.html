        <h3>1 - What is Statistics and its relationship with other disciplines. Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h3>
        <p> Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that involves the collection, description, analysis, and inference 
            of conclusions from quantitative data. The mathematical theories behind statistics rely heavily on differential and
            integral calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory.This science represent the better way to manipulate the data,
            including ways to gather, review, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.</p>
        <p> In practice, statistics is the idea that we can learn about the properties of large sets of objects or events
            (a population) by studying the characteristics of a smaller number of similar objects or events (a sample).
            Gathering comprehensive data about an entire population is too costly, difficult, or impossible in many 
            cases so statistics start with a sample that can be conveniently or affordably observed.</p>

        <p> Statistics is deeply correlated with a lot of disciplines, infact we can see that it involves a lot of mathematical concepts,
            including probability theory, calculus, and linear algebra. <b>Mathematical techniques</b> are used to derive statistical
            methods and models. <b>In the natural sciences,</b> statistics is crucial for experimental design, data analysis, and drawing 
            conclusions. It's used in fields like physics, chemistry, biology, and environmental science. <b>In the social sciences,</b>
            such as psychology, sociology, and economics, statistics helps researchers study human behavior, social trends, and 
            economic phenomena. Statistics is indispensable in <b>medical research and healthcare</b>. It's used for clinical trials, 
            epidemiological studies, and analyzing patient data to make informed decisions about treatments and healthcare policies.
            <b>In business,</b> statistics is used for market research, forecasting, quality control, and decision-making. Economics relies
            heavily on statistics to analyze economic data, measure economic growth, and develop economic models.<b>Data science and 
            machine learning</b> heavily depend on statistics. Algorithms for data analysis, pattern recognition, and machine learning
            are rooted in statistical principles.<b>Finance professionals</b> use statistics for risk assessment, portfolio management, 
            and stock market analysis. Financial models often rely on statistical techniques; but there aren't all the disciplines
            correlated with this subject, there are a lot of more, but all based on the study and manipulation of data</p>

        <h4> Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h4>

        <p> The two major areas of statistics are known as <b>descriptive statistics</b>, which describes the properties of sample and 
            population data, and <b>inferential statistics</b>, which uses those properties to test hypotheses and draw conclusions. 
            Descriptive statistics include mean (average), variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Inferential statistics include linear 
            regression analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), logit/Probit models, and null hypothesis testing.
            <p>The key difference between descriptive and inferential statistics is descriptive statistics aren’t used to make an 
                inference about a broader population, whereas inferential statistics are used for this purpose. Rather than being 
                used to report on the data set itself, inferential statistics are used to generate insights across vast data sets 
                that would be difficult or impossible to analyze.Essentially, descriptive statistics state facts and proven outcomes 
                from a population, whereas inferential statistics analyze samplings to make predictions about larger populations.</p>
            <p>We can make an example of a clinical drug trial, the percentage breakdown of side effect frequency and the mean age 
               represents statistical measures of central tendency and normal distribution within that data set.</p>
            <p>Inferential statistics methods could be applied to draw conclusions about how such side effects occur among
               patients taking this medication. The resulting inferential statistics can help doctors and patients understand the 
               likelihood of experiencing a negative side effect, based on how many members of the sample population experienced it.
               Since descriptive statistics focus on the characteristics of a data set, the certainty level is very high. Outliers
               and other factors may be excluded from the overall findings to ensure greater accuracy, but calculations are often
               much less complex and can result in solid conclusions.</p>
            <p>However, inferential statistics are designed to test for a dependent variable — namely, the population parameter or
               outcome being studied — and may involve several variables. The calculations are more advanced, but the results are 
               less certain. There will be a margin of error as well. After all, inferential statistics are more like highly educated
               guesses than assertions. A sampling error may skew the findings, although a variety of statistical methods can be 
               applied to minimize problematic results.</p>

        <h3>2 - Describe the concepts of Population, Sample Attribute, Variable, Level of measurement and Dataset</h3>

        <p>In statistics, the concept of a <b>population</b> refers to the entire group of individuals, items, or data points that are the subject of
            a study or analysis. This group can be large or small, depending on the scope of the research. Understanding the population is a
            fundamental concept because it helps statisticians draw meaningful conclusions about a particular phenomenon or make inferences about
            a specific group.</p>
        <p>Instead, the concept of <b>attribute</b> refers a quality of an object (person, thing, etc.). Attributes are closely related to variables.
            A <b>variable</b> is a logical set of attributes; Variables can "vary" for example, be high or low. How high, or how low, is determined by the
            value of the attribute. </p>
        <p>While an attribute is often intuitive, the variable is the operationalized way in which the attribute is represented for further data 
            processing. In data processing data are often represented by a combination of items (objects organized in rows), and multiple variables
            (organized in columns).Values of each variable statistically "vary" (or are distributed) across the variable's domain.</p>
        <p><b>The level of measurement</b> refers to the categorization of data based on the properties and characteristics of the values of a variable.
            It helps classify data into different categories or levels, which, in turn, determine the types of statistical analyses and operations 
            that can be applied to the data.</p>
        <p><b>Dataset</b> refers to any organised collection of data. The data set lists values for each of the variables and for each member of the 
            dataset. Each value is known as a datum.So, a dataset is a collection of structured and organized data points or observations.
            These data points can represent information about individuals, objects, events, or any other entities of interest. A dataset 
            typically includes variables that describe different aspects of the entities being studied, and it serves as the foundation 
            for statistical analysis and research. Datasets can be used to draw conclusions, make predictions, and uncover patterns or insights
            through various statistical methods and techniques.</p>

        <h3>3 - Briefly describe the main sampling methods</h3>
        <p>The sample is the group of individuals who will actually participate in the research.To draw valid conclusions from your results,
            you have to carefully decide how you will select a sample that is representative of the group as a whole. This is called a <b>sampling
            method</b>. There are two primary types of sampling methods that you can use in your research: probability sampling methods and 
            non probability sampling methods
            <h4>Probability sampling methods</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="list-item"><b>Simple random sampling:</b>In a simple random sample, every member of the population has an equal chance of being
                    selected. Your sampling frame should include the whole population. To conduct this type of sampling, you can use tools 
                    like random number generators or other techniques that are based entirely on chance.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><b>Systematic sampling:</b>Systematic sampling is similar to simple random sampling, but it is usually slightly 
                    easier to conduct. Every member of the population is listed with a number, but instead of randomly generating numbers, individuals 
                    are chosen at regular intervals.If you use this technique, it is important to make sure that there is no hidden pattern in the
                    list that might skew the sample</li>
                <li class="list-item"><b>Stratified sampling:</b>Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subpopulations that may
                    differ in important ways. It allows you draw more precise conclusions by ensuring that every subgroup is properly represented
                    in the sample. To use this sampling method, you divide the population into subgroups (called strata) based on the relevant
                    characteristic (e.g., gender, identity, age). Based on the overall proportions of the population, you calculate 
                    how many people should be sampled from each subgroup. Then you use random or systematic sampling to select a sample from
                    each subgroup.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><b>Cluster Sampling:</b>population is divided into subgroups where every subgroup has similar characteristics
                    to the whole sample. Instead of selecting individuals, whole subgroups takes part to the sample randomly.</li>             
            </ul>
            <h4>Non probability sampling methods</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="list-item"><b>Convenience sampling:</b>A convenience sample simply includes the individuals who happen to be most accessible
                    to the researcher.This is an easy and inexpensive way to gather initial data, but there is no way to tell if the sample is
                    representative of the population, so it can t produce generalizable results. Convenience samples are at risk for both 
                    sampling bias and selection bias </li>
                <li class="list-item"><b>Voluntary response sampling:</b>Similar to a convenience sample, a voluntary response sample is mainly 
                    based on ease of access. Instead of the researcher choosing participants and directly contacting them, people volunteer
                    themselves.Voluntary response samples are always at least somewhat biased, as some people will inherently be more likely
                    to volunteer than others, leading to self-selection bias. </li>
                <li class="list-item"><b>Purposive sampling:</b>This type of sampling, also known as judgement sampling, involves the researcher
                    using their expertise to select a sample that is most useful to the purposes of the research.It is often used in qualitative
                    research, where the researcher wants to gain detailed knowledge about a specific phenomenon rather than make statistical
                    inferences, or where the population is very small and specific. An effective purposive sample must have clear criteria 
                    and rationale for inclusion. Always make sure to describe your inclusion and exclusion criteria and beware of observer 
                    bias affecting your arguments.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><b>Snowball sampling:</b>If the population is hard to access, snowball sampling can be used to recruit
                    participants via other participants. The number of people you have access to “snowballs” as you get in contact with more people.
                    The downside here is also representativeness, as you have no way of knowing how representative your sample is due to the reliance
                    on participants recruiting others. This can lead to sampling bias.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><b>Quota sampling:</b>Quota sampling relies on the non-random selection of a predetermined number or proportion of units. 
                    This is called a quota.You first divide the population into mutually exclusive subgroups (called strata) and then recruit 
                    sample units until you reach your quota.The aim of quota sampling is to control what or who makes up your sample.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>4 - Briefly describe the main experiment designs</h3>
        <p><b>The design of experiments (DOE or DOX)</b>, also known as experiment design or experimental design, is the design of any task that aims
            to describe and explain the variation of information under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect the variation. The term is
            generally associated with experiments in which the design introduces conditions that directly affect the variation, but may also
            refer to the design of quasi-experiments, in which natural conditions that influence the variation are selected for observation.</p>
        <p>Main concerns in experimental design include the establishment of validity, reliability, and replicability. For example, these concerns
            can be partially addressed by carefully choosing the independent variable, reducing the risk of measurement error, and ensuring that
            the documentation of the method is sufficiently detailed. Related concerns include achieving appropriate levels of statistical power
            and sensitivity.</p>
        <h4>Main Design of experiment</h4>
        <ul>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Objective:</b>learly define the goal or objective of the experiment, such as optimizing a process, testing
                 a hypothesis, or identifying the factors that affect a response</li>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Factors:</b>Identify the independent variables or factors that you want to study. These can be controllable
                 and uncontrollable variables that might influence the outcome.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Levels:</b> Determine the different settings or values for each factor that will be tested during the 
                experiment.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Response:</b>Define the dependent variable or response variable that you are measuring to assess the impact 
                of the factors. This is what you are trying to optimize, improve, or understand.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Randomization:</b> Randomly assign experimental conditions to minimize bias and confounding variables.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Replication:</b>Perform experiments multiple times with the same conditions to account for variability 
                and increase the reliability of results.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Blocking:</b>If there are known sources of variability that should be controlled for, you can group similar
                 experimental units into blocks to reduce the impact of those factors.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Data Analysis:</b> Use statistical methods and analysis techniques to interpret the data collected during the
                experiments, which helps in drawing conclusions and making informed decisions.</li>
        </ul>

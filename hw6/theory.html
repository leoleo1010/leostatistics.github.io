        In statistics, gambler's ruin is the fact that a gambler playing a game with negative expected value will eventually go broke, regardless of their betting system.

The concept was initially stated: A persistent gambler who raises their bet to
 a fixed fraction of the gambler's bankroll after a win, but does not reduce it after a loss, will
  eventually and inevitably go broke, even if each bet has a positive expected value.

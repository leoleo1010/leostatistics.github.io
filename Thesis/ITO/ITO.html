                <h2> Concept </h2>
                <p>Itô calculus, named after Kiyosi Itô, <b>extends</b> the methods of calculus to stochastic processes such as Brownian motion</p>
                <p>The central concept is the Itô stochastic integral, a stochastic generalization of the Riemann–Stieltjes integral in analysis. The integrands and the integrators are now stochastic processes:
                    $$Y_{t}=\int _{0}^{t}H_{s}\,dX_{s},$$
                    where H is a locally square-integrable process adapted to the filtration generated by X  which is a Brownian motion or, more generally, a semimartingale. The result of the integration is then another stochastic process. Concretely, the integral from 0 to any particular t is a random variable, defined as a limit of a certain sequence of random variables. The paths of Brownian motion fail to satisfy the requirements to be able to apply the standard techniques of calculus. So with the integrand a stochastic process, the Itô stochastic integral amounts to an integral with respect to a function which is not differentiable at any point and has infinite variation over every time interval.
                </p>
                <p>The main insight is that the integral can be defined as long as the integrand H is adapted, which loosely speaking means that its value at time t can only depend on information available up until this time.</p>
                <p> Roughly speaking, one chooses a sequence of partitions of the interval from 0 to t and constructs Riemann sums. Every time we are computing a Riemann sum, we are using a particular instantiation of the integrator. It is crucial which point in each of the small intervals is used to compute the value of the function. The limit then is taken in probability as the mesh of the partition is going to zero. Numerous technical details have to be taken care of to show that this limit exists and is independent of the particular sequence of partitions. Typically, the left end of the interval is used.</p>
                <p>The process \(Y_{t}\) defined before is itself a stochastic process with time parameter t, which is also sometimes written as Y = H · X </p>
                <p>\((\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},({\mathcal {F}}_{t})_{t\geq 0},\mathbb {P} ).\)</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">The \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\mathcal{F}_t\) represents the information available up until time \(t\), and a process \(X\) is adapted if \(X_t\) is \(\mathcal{F}_t\)-measurable. A Brownian motion \(B\) is understood to be an \(\mathcal{F}_t\)-Brownian motion, which is just a standard Brownian motion with the properties that \(B_t\) is \(\mathcal{F}_t\)-measurable and that \(B_{t+s} - B_t\) is independent of \(\mathcal{F}_t\) for all \(s, t \geq 0\).
                </p>
                <h4>Integration with respect to Brownian motion</h4>
                <p>The Itô integral can be defined in a manner similar to the Riemann–Stieltjes integral, that is as a limit in probability of Riemann sums; such a limit does not necessarily exist pathwise. Suppose that B is a Wiener process (Brownian motion) and that H is a right-continuous, adapted and locally bounded process.</p>
                <p>If \(\{\pi_n\}\) is a sequence of partitions of \([0, t]\) with mesh going to zero, then the Itô integral of \(H\) with respect to \(B\) up to time \(t\) is a random variable given by
                    $$\int _{0}^{t}H\,dB=\lim _{n\rightarrow \infty }\sum _{[t_{i-1},t_{i}]\in \pi _{n}}H_{t_{i-1}}(B_{t_{i}}-B_{t_{i-1}}).$$
                    It can be shown that this limit converges in probability.
                    </p>
                <p>If \(H\) is any predictable process such that \(\int_0^t H^2 \, ds < \infty\) for every \(t \geq 0\), then the integral of \(H\) with respect to \(B\) can be defined, and \(H\) is said to be \(B\)-integrable. Any such process can be approximated by a sequence \(H_n\) of left-continuous, adapted, and locally bounded processes, in the sense that

                    \[
                    \int_0^t (H - H_n)^2 \, ds \to 0
                    \]
                    
                    in probability. Then, the Itô integral is
                    
                    \[
                    \int_0^t H \, dB = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_0^t H_n \, dB
                    \]
                    
                    where, again, the limit can be shown to converge in probability. The stochastic integral satisfies the Itô isometry
                    
                    \[
                    \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( \int_0^t H_s \, dB_s \right)^2 \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ \int_0^t H_s^2 \, ds \right]
                    \]
                    
                    which holds when \(H\) is bounded or, more generally, when the integral on the right-hand side is finite.

                <h3>Itô processes</h3>
                <p>An  Itô  process is defined to be an adapted stochastic process that can be expressed as the sum of an integral with respect to Brownian motion and an integral with respect to time:

                    \[
                    X_{t} = X_{0} + \int_0^t \sigma_{s}\,dB_{s} + \int_0^t \mu_{s}\,ds.
                    \]
                    
                    Here, \(B\) is a Brownian motion, and it is required that \(\sigma\) is a predictable \(B\)-integrable process, and \(\mu\) is predictable and integrable. That is,
                    
                    \[
                    \int_0^t (\sigma_{s}^{2} + |\mu_{s}|)\,ds < \infty
                    \]
                    
                    for each \(t\). The stochastic integral can be extended to such Itô processes:
                    
                    \[
                    \int_0^t H\,dX = \int_0^t H_{s}\sigma_{s}\,dB_{s} + \int_0^t H_{s}\mu_{s}\,ds.
                    \]
                    
                    This is defined for all locally bounded and predictable integrands. More generally, it is required that \(H\sigma\) be \(B\)-integrable and \(H\mu\) be Lebesgue integrable, so that
                    
                    \[
                    \int_0^t (H^{2}\sigma^{2} + |H\mu|)ds < \infty.
                    \]
                    
                    Such predictable processes \(H\) are called \(X\)-integrable.
                    
                    <p>An important result for the study of Itô processes is Itô's lemma. In its simplest form, for any twice continuously differentiable function \(f\) on the reals and It\^o process \(X\) as described above, it states that \(f(X)\) is itself an Itô process satisfying</p>
                    
                    \[
                    df(X_{t}) = f^{\prime}(X_{t})\,dX_{t} + {\frac{1}{2}}f^{\prime\prime}(X_{t})\sigma_{t}^{2}\,dt.
                    \]
                    
                    This is the stochastic calculus version of the change of variables formula and chain rule. It differs from the standard result due to the additional term involving the second derivative of \(f\), which comes from the property that Brownian motion has non-zero quadratic variation.

                    This simulation demonstrates the dynamics of a geometric Brownian motion and its corresponding Itô integral. Here's a breakdown of the key components:</p>

                                <li style="padding-top: 5px;">The simulation generates a geometric Brownian motion, a stochastic process commonly used to model financial asset behavior.</li>
                                <li style="padding-top: 5px;">GBM is defined by the stochastic differential equation:
                                    \[ dX_t = \mu X_t \, dt + \sigma X_t \, dB_t \]

                                <li style="padding-top: 5px;">In the simulation, \(X_t\) represents the value of the geometric Brownian motion at time \(t\), \(\mu\) is the drift, \(\sigma\) is the volatility, \(dt\) is a small time increment, and \(dB_t\) represents increments of a standard Brownian motion.</li>

                                <li style="padding-top: 5px;">Numerical approximation uses the formula:
                                    \[ \int_0^t X_s \, dB_s \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{t_i} \, (B_{t_i} - B_{t_{i-1}}) \]

                                <li style="padding-top: 5px;">Here, \(t_i\) is a partition of the interval \([0, t]\), and \(B_{t_i} - B_{t_{i-1}}\) represents increments of the Brownian motion. The sum is taken over the partition.</li>

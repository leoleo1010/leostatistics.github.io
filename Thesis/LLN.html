            <h2> Meaning </h2>
            <p>In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of independent identical trials should be close to the expected value and tends to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.</p>
            <p>The LLN is important because it guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events. For example, while a casino may lose money in a single spin of the roulette wheel, its earnings will tend towards a predictable percentage over a large number of spins. Any winning streak by a player will eventually be overcome by the parameters of the game. Importantly, the law applies (as the name indicates) only when a large number of observations are considered. There is no principle that a small number of observations will coincide with the expected value or that a streak of one value will immediately be "balanced" by the others (see the gambler's fallacy).</p>
            <p>The LLN only applies to the average of the results obtained from repeated trials and claims that this average converges to the expected value; it does not claim that the sum of n results gets close to the expected value times n as n increases.</p>

            <p> There are two different versions of the law of large numbers that are described below. They are called the <b><i>strong</i></b> law of large numbers and the <b><i>weak</i></b> law of large numbers.</p>
            <div>
                <h4> Weak law</h4>
                    <p>The weak law of large numbers states that the sample average converges in probability towards the expected value                 
                    </p>

                        Interpreting this result, the weak law states that for any nonzero margin specified (ε), no matter how small, with a sufficiently large sample there will be a very high probability that the average of the observations will be close to the expected value; that is, within the margin.The weak law applies in the case of i.i.d. random variables, but it also applies in some other cases

                <h4> Strong law</h4>
                <p>
                    The strong law of large numbers (also called Kolmogorov's law) states that the sample average converges almost surely to the expected value
                </p>

                <p style="position:relative; bottom: 280px">
                    What this means is that the probability that, as the number of trials n goes to infinity, the average of the observations converges to the expected value, is equal to one. The modern proof of the strong law is more complex than that of the weak law, and relies on passing to an appropriate subsequence
                </p>
                <p style="position:relative; bottom: 280px">
                    Law 3 is called the strong law because random variables which converge strongly (almost surely) are guaranteed to converge weakly (in probability). However the weak law is known to hold in certain conditions where the strong law does not hold and then the convergence is only weak (in probability)

                <h2>Meaning</h2>
                <p>In the theory of probability, the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem (sometimes referred to as the <b>Fundamental Theorem of Statistics</b>)
                    describes the asymptotic behaviour of the empirical distribution function as the number of independent and identically distributed observations grows.
                </p>
                <p>Specifically, the empirical distribution function converges uniformly to the true distribution function almost surely.</p>
                <p>The uniform convergence of more general empirical measures becomes an important property of the Glivenko–Cantelli classes of functions or sets.
                    The Glivenko–Cantelli classes arise in Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory, with applications to <b>machine learning.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Assume that \(…X_1,X_2,\dots\) are independent and identically distributed random variables in \(\mathbb {R}\)  with common cumulative distribution function 
                    \(F(x)\). The empirical distribution function for \(X_{1},\dots ,X_{n}\) is defined by
                    $${\displaystyle F_{n}(x)={\tfrac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}I_{[X_{i},\infty )}(x)={\tfrac {1}{n}}\ {\biggl |}\left\{\ i\ \mid X_{i}\leq x,\ 1\leq i\leq n\right\}{\biggr |}}$$
                    where \(I_{C}\) is the indicator function of the set \({\displaystyle \ C~.}\) For every (fixed) \({\displaystyle \ x\ ,}\)
                    \({\displaystyle \ F_{n}(x)\ }\) is a sequence of random variables which converge to 
                    \(F(x)\) almost surely by the strong law of large numbers. Glivenko and Cantelli strengthened this result by proving uniform convergence of 
                    \({\displaystyle \ F_{n}\ }\) to \({\displaystyle \ F~.}\)

                     convergence than this in the iid case.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>In simpler terms, the supremum (maximum) difference between the empirical distribution function and the true distribution function converges to zero almost surely as the sample size 
                    \(n\) becomes larger. This implies that the empirical distribution function converges uniformly to the true distribution function.</p>
                <p>
                    The Glivenko-Cantelli theorem is a powerful result with important implications for statistical inference. It provides theoretical justification for using the empirical distribution function as an estimator for the true distribution function, especially when dealing with large samples.

                <h2>Proof</h2>
                <p>
                    For simplicity, consider a case of continuous random variable \(X\). Fix 
                    $${\displaystyle -\infty =x_{0}< x_{1}<\cdots < x_{m-1}< x_{m}=\infty }$$
                    such that \({\displaystyle F(x_{j})-F(x_{j-1})={\frac {1}{m}}}\) for  \(j=1,\dots ,m.\) Now for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\) there exists 
                    \({\displaystyle j\in \{1,\dots ,m\}}\) such that \({\displaystyle x\in [x_{j-1},x_{j}]}.\) Note that
                    $${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}F_{n}(x)-F(x)&\leq F_{n}(x_{j})-F(x_{j-1})=F_{n}(x_{j})-F(x_{j})+{\frac {1}{m}},\\F_{n}(x)-F(x)&\geq F_{n}(x_{j-1})-F(x_{j})=F_{n}(x_{j-1})-F(x_{j-1})-{\frac {1}{m}}.\end{aligned}}}$$
                    Therefore,
                    $${\displaystyle \|F_{n}-F\|_{\infty }=\sup _{x\in \mathbb {R} }|F_{n}(x)-F(x)|\leq \max _{j\in \{1,\dots ,m\}}|F_{n}(x_{j})-F(x_{j})|+{\frac {1}{m}}.}$$
                    Since max
                    \({\textstyle \max _{j\in \{1,\dots ,m\}}|F_{n}(x_{j})-F(x_{j})|\to 0{\text{ a.s.}}}\) by strong law of large numbers, we can guarantee
                     that for any positive \({\textstyle \varepsilon }\) and any integer \({\textstyle m}\) such that \({\textstyle 1/m<\varepsilon }\), we can find 
                    \({\textstyle N}\)such that for all \(n\geq N\), we have \({\textstyle \max _{j\in \{1,\dots ,m\}}|F_{n}(x_{j})-F(x_{j})|\leq \varepsilon -1/m{\text{ a.s.}}}\).
                    Combined with the above result, this further implies that \({\textstyle \|F_{n}-F\|_{\infty }\leq \varepsilon {\text{ a.s.}}}\), which is the definition of almost sure convergence.

                    FUNCTIONALS OF STOCHASTIC PROCESSES</h4>

                <p>Figure 1 plots the estimated beta occupation time for each stock in each
                    of the four subsamples. Looking at the estimates for Amazon on the top-left
                    panel, we see that in 2019 the occupation measure of the e-commerce firm’s
                    beta concentrates near (indeed moderately above) unity, and we get essentially the same estimate in the first two months of 2020. However, we find
                    a remarkable left-shift of the occupation time for the later two subsamples
                    during the pandemic, suggesting that Amazon’s market beta has become
                    much lower and, in particular, is below unity most of the time. It is interesting to note that the estimates for the March-April period and the May-June
                    period are virtually the same, despite that they were estimated separately
                    without any restriction. This distributional evidence for Amazon’s reduced
                    sensitivity with respect to the market portfolio suggests that the Amazon
                    stock may play a useful role for diversifying the market-level risk during the
                    crisis. The estimates for Facebook, shown on the top-right panel of Figure
                    1, are similar to those of Amazon in the pre-COVID subsamples (i.e., 2019
                    and 2020 Jan-Feb), as well as the early pandemic period of March and April.
                    However, in the more recent May-June period, the estimate appears to have
                    largely returned to its pre-COVID level, which shows an interesting contrast
                    to Amazon.

                                        The estimates of Boeing and Airlines, shown on the bottom panels of
                    Figure 1, are drastically different from the technology companies. Indeed,
                    their occupation time estimates have evidently shifted to the right during
                    the early pandemic period (March and April), and even more so in the
                    more recent period (May and June). More specifically, we see that, during
                    the pandemic, not only do their occupation measures center at much higher
                    levels of beta, they also become much more dispersed. These findings suggest
                    that firms in the airline industry load on an elevated level of systematic risk,
                    and their risk loadings also bear an additional “layer” of high uncertainty.
                    Overall, this empirical example demonstrates how the proposed uniform
                    estimation theory may be applied in practice. Admittedly, a limitation of the
                    theory developed here is that it only provides consistent functional estimation. Formal hypothesis testing would further require empirical process-type
                    functional central limit theorems (i.e., Donsker theorems) for the family of
                    integrated functionals. Existing results on this issue are rather limited and the empirical-process theory for either nonsmooth test
                    functions (e.g., the occupation time) or noisy data remains to be challenging
                    open questions. These may be interesting topics for future research.

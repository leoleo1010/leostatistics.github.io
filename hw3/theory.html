    <h1>Exercise 2</h1>
    <p>
        A probability space, also known as a probability triple, is a fundamental concept in probability theory. It provides a formal
        framework for understanding and modeling random events and uncertainty. A probability space consists of three key components:
        <ul>
            <li class="list-item"><b> Sample Space (Ω): </b>The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment or
            process. It is denoted as Ω. For example, when rolling a six-sided die, the sample space Ω would be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} 
            because these are all the possible outcomes.</li>

            <li class="list-item"><b> Event Space (F):</b> The event space, denoted as F, is a collection of subsets of the sample space Ω. 
            These subsets represent events that we are interested in, such as the event of rolling an even number on a six-sided die, 
            which can be represented as {2, 4, 6}.</li>

            <li class="list-item"><b> Measure (P):</b> The probability measure, denoted as P, assigns a probability to each event
            in the event space. It is a function that maps events to real numbers and satisfies certain axioms, ensuring that 
            probabilities are non-negative and sum to 1.</li>
        </ul>
        Mathematically, a probability space is represented as the triplet (Ω, F, P). This framework allows us to quantify and 
        work with uncertainty and randomness rigorously.
    </p>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Example 1:</b>
            Consider a fair six-sided die. The sample space Ω is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The event space F includes events like "rolling an 
            even number" {2, 4, 6} and "rolling a prime number" {2, 3, 5}. The probability measure P assigns equal probabilities to each
            outcome, making it a fair die, so P({1}) = P({2}) = ... = P({6}) = 1/6.</li>

            <li class="list-item"><b>Example 2:</b>
            Suppose you are flipping a fair coin. The sample space Ω is {H, T}, representing the possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T).
            The event space F might include events like "getting heads" {H} and "getting tails" {T}. The probability measure P assigns 
            equal probabilities to each outcome, so P({H}) = P({T}) = 0.5.</li>

            <li class="list-item"><b>Example 3:</b>
            Consider drawing a playing card from a standard deck of 52 cards. The sample space Ω consists of all 52 cards in the deck.
            The event space F might include events like "drawing a red card" {hearts, diamonds}, "drawing a face card" {king of hearts,
            queen of diamonds, etc.}, or "drawing a specific card" {ace of spades}. The probability measure P assigns probabilities
            based on the uniformity of the deck, so P({hearts}) = 13/52, P({king of hearts}) = 1/52, and so on.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        In the context of the examples, you can define a probability space (Ω, F, P) as follows:
        <ul>
            <li class="list-item"><b>Sample Space (Ω):</b>

            In this case, the sample space Ω represents all the possible sequences of outcomes for each system over a series of N attacks.
            Ω could be seen as the set of all possible "security score" trajectories for M systems. Each trajectory is a sequence of -1s
            (indicating penetration) and 1s (indicating successful protection) over the N attacks.

            <li class="list-item"><b>Event Space (F):</b>

            The event space F consists of subsets of the sample space Ω. Each event in F represents a specific outcome or set of outcomes 
            for the systems being attacked.
            For Part a, we are interested in events like "the system remained protected throughout all N attacks" or "the system was
            penetrated at least once during the N attacks." For Part b, we would define different events related to the cumulated 
            frequency, relative frequency,and normalized ratio of penetration.

            <li class="list-item"><b>Probability Measure (P):</b>

            The probability measure P assigns probabilities to events in the event space F. It quantifies the likelihood of each event
            occurring based on the system's characteristics and the constant penetration probability p. For Part a, we would assign
            probabilities to events like "the system remained protected throughout all N attacks" based on the constant penetration 
            probability p. For Part b, we would assign probabilities to events like "cumulated frequency of penetration," "relative 
            frequency of penetration," and "normalized ratio of penetration" based on the characteristics of the attacks and the
            number of attacks. The specific values assigned by the probability measure would depend on the details of the simulation 
            and the parameters of the model. 
            This probability space allows to analyze and model the behavior of the systems under repeated attacks and assess the
            likelihood of different outcomes.
